*whoami*? My real name is Logan but because I am also a self-proclaimed hacker, my handle is *NetworkShadow* and 
that is what I use on platforms such as TryHackMe and HackTheBox.

I am a recent graduate of the Holland College *Computer Information Systems* program where I learned fundamentals 
in software development. However, I also began learning, albeit mostly on my own, how to hack. This is where I found 
a real passion in information technology.

**So what do I do now?** I work for Veterans Affairs Canada as a tester for one of their projects where I perform various
tasks such as the following:

 - Development and maintenance of an automated regression test project using Selenium and an UnderTest framework.
 - Manual regression testing, where and when necessary.
 - And as of recently, the development and maintenance of a load testing project using Gatling where I also operate
the load testing locally on remote servers to test load and performance with various parameters.

**But what do I want to do?** I want to work in cybersecurity. More specifically, I want to hack. I want to break 
things and help businesses and organizations find out how someone like me, but with bad intentions, can protect 
themselves and show them where they've left themselves vulnerable to an attack or data breach. 

Not just that though, I am really starting to appreciate the *blue team* side of things. In particular, I've 
recently developed a strong interest in malware analysis, which you can keep an eye out for in my blog.

Keep an eye out, and you might just learn something. Something you think I should or can learn? *Please* reach out to
me. I mean that. Contact me. Let me know some things I could learn. I love learning!
